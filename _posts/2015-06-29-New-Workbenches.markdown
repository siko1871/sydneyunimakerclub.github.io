With the end of semester 1, we've had some members itching to get into their winter holiday projects. In the making, are a couple of workbenches made by our handy wood-makers, Kye and Andrew (a.k.a Smarty). 

Following up with some of the considerations made by some of the research we did with designing a makerspace, we decided we'd need some basic configurable workbenches which could be moved around depending on whether we ran group activities like workshops, or wanted to be used for a fast prototyping space, tucked neatly away from other workspaces. 

With these ideal requirements in place and a restricted budget, Kye and Andrew have taken up the challenge of making a couple of workbenches that would be space efficient, good for storage, and - most importantly - reconfigurable for the various projects we'd have going on. 

Here's a photo of them after the first four hours of their first workbench:

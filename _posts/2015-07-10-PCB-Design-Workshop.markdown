*Workshop description*:

You will be taught about the design process of PCB manufacture and how to make your own custom PCB with Altium Designer and CircuitMaker - EDA tools used in industry and by makers, respectively. You'll go through the process of sourcing components from electronics suppliers. As an example, we'll be designing a breadboard power supply. Cost will be free for any makerclub member (any usyd student can sign up for free). If you'd like to get your PCB manufactured, you'll be able to do so at a small price (~5-10 dollars), depending on how compact you can get your design and how many want to get theirs made. If you go to this workshop, you'll be able to have it follow on to the next workshop which will be a soldering workshop. Welcome for all levels. Suitable for anyone who's new to electronics.

*What to bring*:

- Come wearing closed in shoes. You will be turned away if you are wearing sandals or thongs.
- Computers and software *will be* supplied.
